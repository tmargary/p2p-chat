# Peer to peer console application

### Goals of the project

This is a peer to peer console chat application. The clients are able to connect to the server and 
obtain the list of available clients. Afterwards, the client can connect to one other client on the list and 
exchange text messages directly to one another.

### How to use the program?
- run `pip install .` from the root of the project
- Run `p2p_demo run server`
- From a different terminal, run `p2p_demo run client`
- (Optional) Continue adding as many clients as you need by running the command above.
- Follow the prompts.
- (Optional) To get help about `p2p_demo`, run `p2p_demo --help`
- (Optional) To get help about the main `run` functionality, run `p2p_demo run --help`

### To be improved
- Ability to exchange messages without further help from the server
- Implement a GUI
- Connect users outside the localhost via the Internet
